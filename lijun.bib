  abstract  = {An accurate and fast estimation of microseismic activities from passive microseismic data is a crucial issue to many oil and gas applications. Traditional methods are mainly based on manual picking of the arrival times which require a relative high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to produce reliable results. When the sensor array is deployed on the surface, the microseismic events have low magnitude and might be buried in strong ambient noise. A compressive sensing scheme has been introduced to implement seismic source parameters estimation, including location (i.e., hypocenter) and moment tensor (MT). Although this scheme is efficient and accurate, it entails computing the whole dictionary composed of Green's functions in advance, which brings a high computational overhead and prohibitive storage burden. In this work, we propose the differential evolution (DE) algorithm for solving the inverse problem on the fly which avoids generating and storing the whole dictionary.},

  abstract  = {Parametric speakers produce sound by emitting ultrasound, and using the small nonlinearity in air to demodulate it back to audible sound. The use of ultrasound allows for producing very narrow audio beams, which finds application in a number of military and consumer scenarios. However, designing better parametric speakers has been hard: closed-form solution of the nonlinear wave equation for generic geometries is nearly impossible, and the only existing solution was derived for the simple case of a cylindrical beam. FDTD methods were considered not practical since the desired (audible) signal is orders of magnitude weaker than the ultrasound signal, and thus the noise floor (from the numerical approximation) will dwarf the audible signal. In this paper, we introduce a novel FDTD scheme that models nonlinear sound propagation for parametric speakers. By taking the difference between linear and nonlinear FDTD simulations, we successfully suppress the numerical noise floor and extract the audible signal. Both spectrum and radiation pattern of simulation match the measurements well. This offers a simulation tool for further research in creating advanced parametric speakers.},

  abstract  = {Traditional seismology primarily focuses on seismic events with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is mainly because reliable picks cannot be made for events with low SNR, so a relatively high threshold is set to avoid false picks. A recent study in the 5200-station Long Beach array shows that random sampling [Zhu et al., 2016] is able to rapidly distinguish the true picks from false ones, which makes reliable detection/location of bad SNR events possible [Li et al., 2016]. However, that study did not consider different confidence levels of the picks, which can be quantified by short-term-average/long-term-average ratio (STA/LTA). In this study, we incorporate this information into our event detection and location method, which leads to a weighted random sampling algorithm. We plan to apply this algorithm to the Long Beach dense array to examine the improvement in event detection/location. In addition, this algorithm can be customized into a new global seismic detection and location framework. In this new framework, the picking threshold can be lowered significantly to include more picks, both true and false, and weighted random sampling is applied to select those weak true picks that were previously below noise threshold and use them for event location. We plan to apply this algorithm to both regional and global seismic networks, and systematically evaluate event detection results compared to those from standard processing procedure. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.},

  abstract = {Passive microseismic data are commonly buried in noise, which presents a significant challenge for signal detection and recovery. For recordings from a surface sensor array where each trace contains a time-delayed arrival from the event, we propose an autocorrelation-based stacking method that designs a denoising filter from all the traces, as well as a multi-channel detection scheme. This approach circumvents the issue of time aligning the traces prior to stacking because every trace's autocorrelation is centred at zero in the lag domain. The effect of white noise is concentrated near zero lag; thus, the filter design requires a predictable adjustment of the zero-lag value. Truncation of the autocorrelation is employed to smooth the impulse response of the denoising filter. In order to extend the applicability of the algorithm, we also propose a noise prewhitening scheme that addresses cases with coloured noise. The simplicity and robustness of this method are validated with synthetic and real seismic traces.},

  abstract  = {In practice, passive surface microseismic data often has low SNR, so arrival times picked on single traces are unreliable.  False picks that are far from the true arrival times are common which can severely degrade the accuracy of subsequent estimation of an event moveout curve which leads to a poor event location estimate. Our previous work utilized a RANdom SAmpling Consensus (RANSAC) based scheme to improve arrival time estimates from first-break picking. In this paper, we present an improved RANSAC curve fitting scheme to approximate any parametric moveout curve, e.g., hyperbolic, which can also efficiently classify the picks distorted by noise into true and false picks. The proposed method is a significant extension of last year's method with respect to its accuracy, stability, and efficiency. 2-D arrays with hyperboloid moveout surfaces are now addressed in a robust manner. Results are validated with a large-scale dataset from passive earthquake monitoring.},
