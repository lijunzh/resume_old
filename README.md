# Lijun Zhu's Resume
This is the repo for Lijun Zhu's resume. I keep updating it whenever new project/work/publication is available.

## Template Source
This resume repo uses template in [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). To acoomendate the publication list, I add some extra code to straighten up the format. It also includes a submodule from my [personal BibTex library repo](https://github.com/lijunzh/publication).

## Different Branches
Some branches that derived from current or previous master are speciallized to certain company/industry. However, I try to keep the practice to create a new branch every time I apply for a company for isolation and documentation. At least, I will have a local branch dedicated to that job application. In the meantime, routine updates that suppose to affect all branches happens in the master branch.
